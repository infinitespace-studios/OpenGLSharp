# OpenGLSharp
OpenGL Library for SDL2, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android

The goals of this project is to provide a minimal OpenGL implementation for
MonoGame. It *might* b expanded in the future. 

It should be 

	* Low level
	* Cross platform
	* Hide API differences between GL and GLES (where possible)
	
Nice to have

	* PCL Support via Bait and Switch.
